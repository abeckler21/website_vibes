        <h2 id="in-brief"># in brief</h2>
        <p>
          I'm currently an MPCS student in the Computer Science department at the University of Chicago, 
          currently working on projects with 
          <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~glk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Gordon Kindlmann
          </a> and 
          <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~shasha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Dennis Shasha
          </a>.
          I grew up in New York City (greatest city in the world, in my personal opinion), but I've 
          grown to love Chicago over the past 5 years. You'll often find me at the 
          CSO or Lyric Opera, or find me reahearsing for my next performance with the
          <a href="https://music.uchicago.edu/performance-opportunities/instrumental/piano-program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          UChicago Piano Performance Program
          </a>. I'm a huge Eagles fan (Go Birds!), a horrific chef, and a reality TV aficionado.

        <p>
          My research lies at the intersection of <b>machine learning interpretability</b>, 
          <b>visual analytics</b>, and <b>human–computer interaction</b>. 
          I work with 
          <a href="https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~glk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Gordon Kindlmann
          </a> 
          at the University of Chicago on 
          <i>Non-Equivariance Revealed on Orbits (NERO)</i>, a visualization system for analyzing 
          how neural networks respond to transformations in input data. 
          I also collaborate with 
          <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~shasha/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Dennis Shasha
          </a> 
          at NYU on 
          <i>PatentNerd</i>, an AI-powered platform that uses large language models to evaluate 
          and refine patent claims. 
          Together, these projects combine computational rigor with visual reasoning — 
          helping humans better understand how models and ideas behave.

          I've served as a <b>Teaching Assistant</b> for several core computer science courses at 
          the University of Chicago, including 
          <i>Introduction to Computer Science I & II</i> and 
          <i>Data Visualization</i>. I also was one of the primary instructors for the 
          <a href="https://scuba.cs.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            2023 Summer Coding at UChicago: Builder's Academy
          </a> program here at the UChicago, teaching programming fundamentals to 25 Chicago public
          school students over the course of a summer. 
          One more: I founded and led a <b>Girls Who Code</b> program right here at Carnegie Elementary School 
          that introduced middle-school 
          students to creative coding, robotics, and computational thinking — experiences that 
          shaped my belief in accessible, inclusive CS education.
